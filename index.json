[{"categories":["sustainable-living"],"contents":"More and more people are concerned about how food affects their environmental footprint. The most common advice we hear and read about limiting our \u0026ldquo;foodprint\u0026rdquo; is to buy locally-grown food. However, another factor has a much greater impact on the environment.\nBuying local is great. You support local jobs and reinject money into the local economy, and you know where the food comes from. You might even know the producer personally! It also significantly decreases \u0026ldquo;food miles\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;the distance that food travels to reach your local supermarket. Imported food usually travels thousands of miles, through lengthy truck and plane trips.\n Purchasing from local producers fuels the local economy and reduces the greenhouse gas emissions associated with food miles.\n But, transport only represents 5% of the food\u0026rsquo;s overall emissions, and we often overlook that some foods are inherently more harmful to the environment than others, regardless of where they\u0026rsquo;re produced. Since food production accounts for 25% of global emissions, choosing what we eat carefully can reduce them dramatically.\nSo, what\u0026rsquo;s the most eco-friendly food?\nUnsurprisingly, animal-based products have a larger footprint than plant-based ones. Indeed, we need to grow crops to feed the animals and give them space to graze. Also, cattle emit greenhouse gas on their own (e.g. methane, nitrous oxide).\nCheck out this graph to get an idea of the impact of protein-rich food on the planet.\nAmong animal-based products, beef has clearly the highest environmental impact. It generates 3 times as much greenhouse gas emissions as any other meat and pollutes water a lot.\nLamb and mutton are second. They emit less methane than beef and don\u0026rsquo;t cause deforestation since they can graze pretty much anywhere\u0026mdash;including in woods. However, they do require massive space and worsen water scarcity.\nOn the other hand, poultry and pig have the lowest environmental footprints. In fact, since they are non-ruminant livestock, they don\u0026rsquo;t produce methane, which accounts for the major part of beef and lamb\u0026rsquo;s emissions.\n Poultry generates 10 times fewer carbon emissions than beef and uses 30 times less land than lamb!\n To sum up, the best way to reduce our \u0026ldquo;foodprint\u0026rdquo; is to select products with the lowest overall environmental impact. Food miles are definitely part of this impact\u0026mdash;and buying locally comes with various social and economic benefits\u0026mdash;but there\u0026rsquo;s more to the story.\nBefore you go, here\u0026rsquo;s a cheat sheet of food quantities that have the same carbon footprint. Feel free to download it to get some inspiration for your next run to the grocery store.\n","date":"January 8, 2022","image":"https://www.timeforachange.xyz/images/post/food_hu9bbcba0d2467e3eb2a219aa0c863c30b_380712_650x0_resize_q90_box.jpg","permalink":"/what-we-eat-is-more-important-for-food-environmental-footprint-than-where-it-comes-from/","title":"To reduce our food's environmental footprint, what we eat is far more important than where it comes from"},{"categories":["innovation"],"contents":"In the UK, Fat Macy\u0026rsquo;s is a social enterprise that uses its restaurant and events catering business to train and support Londoners living in temporary accommodation and help them move into their own homes.\nThe organization provides a 200-hour program where trainees learn from professional chefs, work in front-of-house roles and help run the business.

According to their research, a generator can power a home for several days with just 2.4 litres of water\u0026mdash;half of what we need to flush a toilet once.\nThe company has deployed its innovation across 33 countries and expects to start mass production in 2023.\nWhy does it matter? About 80 percent of global energy consumption still relies on fossil fuels. Green hydrogen is poised to be a credible alternative, but some researchers have criticized the currently available technologies for their low efficiency and high cost.\nEnapter claims its AEM Electrolyser solves these issues and provides an economically attractive way to produce clean energy, even at home.\n👜 The Mall That Only Sells Upcycled Products In Sweden, ReTuna Återbruksgalleria is the world\u0026rsquo;s first mall that combines a recycling centre with a circular-economy-centric shopping experience.\nThere, you can drop off old toys, furniture, clothes, decorative items, and electronic devices in the mall\u0026rsquo;s depot. Then, the organization distributes the reusable items to the mall\u0026rsquo;s recycling shops that fix them up and resell them.\nThrough this cycle, ReTuna has created a one-stop-shop to recycle unwanted goods and buy something \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; in the process\u0026mdash;giving old items a new life and reducing our environmental footprint.\nWhy does it matter? Almost 60% of the world\u0026rsquo;s waste ends up in landfills, eventually releasing toxins that contaminate the soil and groundwater and emitting dangerous greenhouse gases.\nReTuna Återbruksgalleria revolutionizes shopping in a climate-smart way by keeping items in perfect condition out of the landfills\u0026mdash;and participating in the Swedish recycling revolution.\n🎯 The Pick In Shanghai, Home of Hope is the city\u0026rsquo;s first dance group that includes only people with paraplegia, aiming to reshape perceptions of accessibility in China.\nAfter a car accident in 2012, Pan Jing\u0026mdash;a Chinese professional dancer\u0026mdash;undertook spinal cord rehabilitation at Shanghai\u0026rsquo;s Sunshine Medical Rehabilitation Centre. There, she had the idea to create dance routines for people in wheelchairs.\nSince forming in 2014, the dancers have performed more than 70 shows, including some on national television. The group inspired many patients along the way and helped its members process their traumatic experiences. Today, the people involved hope its influence will spread outside of the program to reach more people with disabilities.\nWhy does it matter? In China, people with disabilities often encounter physical and social barriers as the country has stigmatized disability for a long time. Indeed, the official term to refer to people with disabilities until the mid-1980s was \u0026ldquo;*Canfei\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;*a combination of two Chinese characters meaning \u0026ldquo;incomplete\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;useless.\u0026rdquo; Today, things are shifting, and several groups are pushing to start using other terms.\nHome of Hope is a safe space where its members feel accepted and understood. They hope their performances can play a part in changing Chinese society\u0026rsquo;s views regarding disabilities.\n🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide \u0026hellip; 🏠 Japan developed the first-ever carbon-negative concrete. By using CO2 gas instead of water during the curing process, one cubic metre of CO2-SUICOM removes 18kg of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere instead of the 288 kilograms emitted by traditional concrete.\n🎬 17-year-old Mariella Satow developed SignUp, a chrome extension that provides sign language versions of Disney+ classics like Frozen, Moana, and The Incredibles. This extension aims to make movies accessible to audiences who cannot hear and read subtitles (e.g. young deaf viewers).\n✈ Alaska Airlines is the first major airline to eliminate plastic cups to serve water to passengers. The company estimates that this measure will save 800,000 kg of single-use plastic each year.\n🌳 In the UK, Hugh Huddy and Madeleine Sugden created a podcast that features the sounds of the landscapes the family has discovered on walks and other trips. Eighteen months after its launch, Radio Lento already hit 117,000 downloads!\n🔋 A recent study showed that recycled lithium batteries have better life cycle energy retention than brand new ones. This discovery opens opportunities to create a circular flow that would prevent mining new lithium\u0026mdash;and the associated harmful consequences.\n😍 Wholesomeness  That\u0026rsquo;s a wrap.

The hydrogel generates hydrogen peroxide to neutralize more than 99.999% of bacteria by attacking their essential cell components and disrupting their metabolism.\nMoreover, the researchers say that scaling production would be straightforward. Indeed, materials are cheap, and the synthesis process is simple, even at scale. Also, they can control the tablets' shape and size to adapt them to different use cases.\nWhy does it matter? Almost a third of the world does not have clean drinking water, and half of the population could experience extreme water scarcity by 2025. The existing purification processes rely on boiling water, which requires a lot of energy and time, and is not practical for the people who lack clean water the most.\nFinding a solution to the water crisis could save millions of people. In this context, these hydrogel tablets can make a massive difference as they are easy to use, highly efficient and scalable to mass production.\n🌎 Meanwhile, Worldwide\u0026hellip; 🚘 Swedish automobile manufacturer Volvo wants all of its vehicles to be leather-free by 2030.

Today, this busy eight-lane highway prevents many animals from travelling freely between the two mountainous areas, limiting genetic diversity and leading some species to extinction.\n👕 Ralph Lauren brought together innovators to develop a way to colour cotton using 90% fewer chemicals, 50% less water, 50% less dye and 40% less energy than traditional methods. This month, the companies released an open-source manual detailing how to achieve the same result with already existing dyeing equipment.\n🧊 The WWF and British Antarctic Survey seek help from the public to monitor the number of walrus in the Arctic using satellite images. The Walrus From Spaceproject aims to paint a clear picture of the walrus population without disturbing the animals.\n🐚 Researchers from McGill University developed a new type of glass, inspired by the inner layer of mollusc shells, five times more resistant than traditional glass. They hope manufacturers will use this new material to replace cell phone glass and other electronics components.\n😊 Wholesomeness  That\u0026rsquo;s a wrap.

Otherwise, many cities worldwide feature toy hospitals that can repair and clean the toys we want to keep and pass on to the next generation. Finally, the Internet is full of DIY videos and posts that explain how to use old toys to build new furniture and decorative objects.  The relationship between a toy and its owner goes beyond the utilitarian aspect. Charlotte\u0026rsquo;s wholesome initiative enables perpetuating our memories while reducing the environmental footprint of the toy industry.\n🎯 The Pick The London-based organization EcoLogicStudio designed a children\u0026rsquo;s play centre called AirBubble that uses algae in solar-powered bioreactors to remove pollutants from the air.\nSolar energy powers photosynthesis by which algae split carbon dioxide into carbon, which it uses to feed, and oxygen, which it releases into the room. On the other hand, the children\u0026rsquo;s play activates machinery that moves liquid through the bioreactors, ensuring proper aeration.\nAccording to the designer, the system can filter up to 200 litres of air per minute and purify the entire structure in less than 24h, driving pollution levels down to within World Health Organization guidelines. Moreover, this process transforms pollutants into biomass, a raw material for bioplastics, food supplements, natural cosmetics and more. So, we ultimately end up with usable byproducts instead of waste.\nWhy does it matter? EcoLogicStudio chose to install AirBubble in Warsaw, Poland, one of the most polluted cities in Europe, to educate people about air quality in a playful way. Indeed, the link between urban air quality, respiratory health and public well-being has become more evident during Covid, and tackling this issue is crucial for our future. Also, the organization wants to inspire future generations to find innovative solutions for our current problems.\nWhat can we do?  In urban areas, most of our trips are less than a few kilometres long. Using public transportation, biking or walking for these trips can go a long way to reducing pollution.  Using an electric vehicle is also highly effective. Indeed, thermic cars are particularly suboptimal for short travels involving many stops. Also, studies showed that planting tiny forests in cities can improve biodiversity, air quality and even our well-being. As citizens of these cities, we can vote and advocate to move these initiatives forward.  Whoever spends time with kids realizes that they are an inextinguishable source of energy. This fantastic project leverages this energy to provide our children with a pure atmosphere and educate them on the importance of air quality.\n🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide \u0026hellip; 🚀 Researchers from The University of Texas have found a low-cost and efficient way to split off oxygen molecules from water using sunlight. This discovery solves a significant hurdle to sustainably producing hydrogen from water.\n📌 Google Maps will show the most fuel-efficient route alongside the fastest one and the amount of fuel you can save with a slight detour. This new release also indicates flights' CO2 emissions, sustainability information about hotels and businesses, among others.\n♻ In Denmark, the Re-Wind Network explores ways to reuse old wind blades in architectural and engineering structures, such as protective bike shelters or pedestrian bridges. Indeed, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible to recycle these blades until recently. Therefore, most of them ended up in the landfill.\n🚄 The French National Railway Company (SNCF) kickstarted an initiative to recycle the 5,000 unused rail cars collecting dust and rust throughout the country. The company pledged to find a new purpose for all of those trains by 2028.\n🌊 Scientists in the US designed a system that can filter out microplastics from water without ever clogging. This mechanism mimics how manta rays filter out plankton by using a complex pattern of whirlpools that moves the microplastics away from the filter.\n😍 Wholesomeness  That\u0026rsquo;s a wrap.

This creative initiative, which started last year after a fire occurred in the area, goes beyond protecting Ireland\u0026rsquo;s capital city.\nIndeed, the Old Irish Goat is a critically endangered species that used to graze in these hills and handle the upkeep over a century ago. However, cross-breeding with imported species reduced their original population dramatically. As a result, this species only survived thanks to the Old Irish Goat Society, an organization dedicated to conserving these goats and keeping their DNA free from domestic goat genetics.\nThe organization happily provided 25 of their goats to this firefighting reintroduction project, which will combine traditional herding methods with new technology (e.g. GPS tracking). The goal is to progressively add new males to grow the herd\u0026rsquo;s headcount to 100.\nWhy does it matter? Wildfires have become increasingly frequent with the decline of traditional grazing, even in the wet Irish climate. In recent years, global warming has further reinforced this phenomenon. Besides managing fire risk, this project will enhance the biodiversity of the heathland habitat.\nThe Old Irish Goat can control the accumulation of gorse and feed on harsh environments with low nutritive quality heathlands. Thus, they offer an economical and sustainable solution to managing the landscape.\n🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide \u0026hellip; 🚗 London Electric Cars provides services to convert any car into an electric one. Indeed, converting a car is less labour-intensive and more affordable than purchasing a brand new one.

These tiles mimic natural coral reefs to speed up the restoration of the local coral population.\n✈ In the UK, Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) creates helium-based aeroplanes that emit 75% less than their kerosene-based counterparts. Although these aeroplanes look like Zeppelins, they use helium instead of hydrogen, leveraging the benefits of lighter-than-air technology without the risk of explosion.\n☁ A team of researchers, led by the University of Washington, is currently investigating how to reduce global warming using \u0026hellip; artificial clouds! The idea of the Marine Cloud Brightening Project is to generate bright clouds from seawater to reflect the sunlight and reduce the temperature of the sea.\n🍊 The Italian company Krill Design produced the first 3D printed lamp from Sicilian orange peels.

At the end of the training, each dog is paired with a trainer to form an elite SICS unit that saves lives.\nThe man behind this initiative, Ferruccio Pilenga, had the idea to train his dog in the late 1980s after discovering how good a swimmer he was. According to Ferrucio, his dog \u0026ldquo;pulled a water-filled dinghy with three people on board for half an hour\u0026rdquo;: a feat that no human could achieve!\nWhy does it matter? Thanks to their strength, willingness to perform, and bond with their trainer, SICS dogs save around 30 lives every year. Moreover, their intensive training makes them particularly effective in life-or-death scenarios where the capabilities of one or two lifeguards might be easily overwhelmed.\nItaly is currently the only country to recognize canine lifeguards officially. However, SICS is setting up training centres in the US, Germany, Switzerland and Spain to spread its knowledge and ensure safer waters worldwide.\n🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide\u0026hellip; ⚽ The Forest Green Rovers is the world\u0026rsquo;s first carbon-neutral soccer club with a 100% renewable-energy powered stadium, a fertilizer-free lawn and a vegan-only menu for the fans.

So far, the company has processed more than 20 tonnes of plastic waste and created more than 100 jobs for garbage collectors, women and youth.\n🚗 Researchers from Texas A\u0026amp;M University propose to capture water and carbon dioxide (CO2) from passenger vehicle exhaust and use it to grow food. An average passenger car in operation can emit about 4.6 metric tons of CO2 and 21,000 litres of water per year. Repurposing these two wasted products would reduce cars' carbon footprint while helping the agricultural industry.\n🛰 Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is about to launch Privateer Space, a new company focused on monitoring and cleaning up objects in space.

The technology, called GrowStream, uses tubes that can sense those chemicals and release water and nutrients through billions of \u0026ldquo;smart micropores.\u0026rdquo; Once the plants have had enough, they stop emitting the chemical, and the technology\u0026rsquo;s pores close until the plants need irrigation again.\nThe company has installed this irrigation system in 14 different countries so far. For instance, in the dry areas of Pakistan, vegetables like tomatoes and bok choy grow 81% faster and twice as large than with regular drip irrigation. Also, in Los Angeles, RDI works with the city to irrigate green spaces while using 45% to 50% less water than drip irrigation.\nWhy does it matter? Water is more and more scarce around the globe because of global warming. Growing food in dry climates where water is rare is crucial for the survival of billions of people. Moreover, in highly-populated cities, green spaces are essential to avoid heat islands and improve overall well-being.\nIn this context, RDI\u0026rsquo;s technology revolutionizes irrigation in the face of global warming, droughts and water shortages.\n🎯 The Pick Desert cities in the Middle East, Egypt, Pakistan and India have suffered scorching summers for millennia.

The Orbital O2 generates enough green electricity for 2,000 homes and will operate for 15 years while saving 2,200 tonnes of CO2 per year.\n🤖 In Zurich, students created a system combining an AI-powered robotic arm and bubbles to remove plastic from polluted rivers. Concretely, bubbles form a \u0026ldquo;wall\u0026rdquo; that redirects waste to a conveyor belt. The robotic arm then identifies the waste and removes it while releasing organic matter back into the water.\n🚢 Maersk, the world\u0026rsquo;s largest container shipping firm, announced the launch of a new fleet that runs on carbon-neutral methanol. These new vessels will pave the way for decarbonization in the maritime and shipping industry by saving a million tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year.\n🐛 The Singapore startup Insectta is transforming waste into high-value biomaterials using insects. But, unlike most companies using insects to manage waste, Insectta delivers more than just agricultural products. For example, it developed technologies to extract chitosan (an antimicrobial substance used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products) and even biodegradable semiconductors!\n🐧 In Germany, Hereon and EvoLogics designed the Quadroin, a penguin-shaped 3D-printed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), to analyze eddies. These oceanic phenomena influence all life in the seas and the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate but are tough to study because of their small size and short lifespan. Deploying a swarm of these robots will enable these studies' advancement and expand our knowledge of the oceans and life itself.\n😍 Wholesomeness  That\u0026rsquo;s a wrap.

Bhutan is the world’s first carbon-negative country and more."},{"categories":["newsletter"],"contents":"Hallo 👋 Did you know? Besides environmental results, investing in a marine protected area could yield a tenfold return on investment through benefits for biodiversity, fishing and tourism 🐠\n📈 Uplifting Trends and Facts  Bhutan is the world\u0026rsquo;s first carbon-negative country. By incorporating sustainability into its national identity, this Asian country achieved this feat while becoming one of the world\u0026rsquo;s happiest countries. In the last 20 years, the amount of land devoted to grazing animals to produce meat and milk has begun to shrink worldwide. This land takes twice as much space as agriculture, driving deforestation and degrading grassland while providing only a fraction of our nutritional needs. In Sweden, only one in every 200 tonnes of waste ends up at a landfill site. Following the \u0026ldquo;recycling revolution,\u0026rdquo; the country now recycles virtually all their garbage, edging closer to a zero-waste lifestyle. Under a new European Union legislation, companies that sell consumer electronics in the EU and the UK will need to ensure those goods are easy to repair for up to 10 years.  🏊‍♂️ The Company That Turns Containers Into Swimming Pools The Vancouver-based company Modpools converts shipping containers into swimming pools. The CEO, Paul Rathnam, compares containers to cardboard boxes. \u0026ldquo;They take all of our cargo around the world, safely. And, they\u0026rsquo;re reusable,\u0026rdquo; he says. Like kids building new structures out of old boxes, Paul has been upcycling containers into usable spaces for many years.\nModpools purchases single-use containers to make sure they\u0026rsquo;re as pristine as possible and uses them as building blocks for its pools. Since the construction happens beforehand in the company\u0026rsquo;s factory near Vancouver, the installation is typically completed within a day. Families can then enjoy luxury-looking pools and spas without the usual on-site burden of construction.\nThe company already installed about 800 pools across North America and has recently increased its production capacity as the pandemic drove people to make their homes more comfortable and spend their vacations in their backyard.\nWhy does it matter? Because of the US-China trade deficit, most containers carrying goods from China to America never return and are, therefore, left to rust when they are not recycled.\nModpools seized this opportunity to create a sustainable business that upcycles waste into luxury goods that families can use for decades.\n🌷 The Wind Turbines That Are Also Pieces of Art The Dutch-American company Flower Turbines creates elegant tulip-shaped wind turbines that pose no danger to wildlife and whose noise is undetectable to humans.\nDr. Daniel Farb, the company\u0026rsquo;s CEO, addressed these issues with patented aerodynamic innovations. While most wind turbines start at 3 m/s, the Wind Tulip is already producing 25-30 watts at this speed. Moreover, traditional turbines cannot be placed close together at the risk of interfering with each other. On the other hand, Wind Tulips drive wind tunnels into each other \u0026ndash; making their neighbours perform 20-50% better. Thanks to these innovations, these good-looking turbines are extremely efficient (up to 40%, against 7-10% for their conventional counterparts), especially under slow wind and in limited spaces. They are, therefore, particularly adapted to urban settings.\nWhy does it matter? Wind farms' opponents often cite noise and biodiversity concerns along with aesthetic issues. As a result, city residents do not leverage wind energy, despite its huge potential, and rely on solar power as a local source of clean energy. However, the latter doesn\u0026rsquo;t perform well at night or during the winter. The Wind Tulips make wind energy available for everybody by allowing people to live and work next to them. Coupled with already existing solar energy sources, they could be the future of locally-produced urban clean energy.\n🎯 The Pick In the Quad Cities, USA, the Bison Bridge project aims to repurpose Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge on Interstate I-80 to create a wildlife crossing that provides safe passage for bison herds.\nBesides saving Illinois millions in demolition costs, this initiative could also attract tourists to this somewhat overlooked part of the country. Indeed, the bridge would feature a prairie strip for the bison to roam as well as a pedestrian area including viewing stations and cafés.\nThe project is currently in the study and waiting for the approval of the State of Illinois and the Federal Highways Administration. If everything goes according to plan, the construction should begin in 2026 after the design and engineering phases. Why does it matter? The bison was a key species for the Native American tribes as it provided them with food, clothing, shelter and was central to their cultural and spiritual belief systems. They also played a crucial part in the plains' ecosystem until overhunting brought their numbers down to 300.\nThis project is the perfect opportunity to educate the American people on the bison while improving biodiversity and boosting the local economy.\n🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide\u0026hellip; 🥇 In Brussels, a team of scientists are mining gold and silver from the city\u0026rsquo;s sewage. Recycling gold is around 300 times less carbon-intensive than mining it, and studies estimate that Belgium\u0026rsquo;s sewage could provide up to €1.3 million a year in precious metals. Scientists hope that these metals will one day pay for the cost of clean water.\n🌊 Software giant IBM recently launched PlasticNet, an open-source machine learning project that can detect different types of trash in the ocean. The goal is to develop robust detection models and implement them on real-time satellite and camera footage.\n🚢 Crowley Maritime Corporation has recently revealed its design for the world\u0026rsquo;s first 100% electric tugboat. The \u0026ldquo;eWolf\u0026rdquo; is expected to hit the water in 2023 and will prevent the emission of 178 tons of nitrogen oxide (NOx), 2.5 tons of diesel particulate matter, and 3,100 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) over its first decade of operation.\n📱 Archer Calder, a Texas teenager, developed an app to help his nonverbal sister communicate with the rest of the world. Unlike other very expensive alternatives, Freespeech is completely free and open-source.\n🏴‍☠️ Clean Ocean Sailing is a group of sailors, surfers, swimmers and divers that remove pieces of plastics from the ocean in Cornwall. So far, they have gathered 50 tonnes of plastic. Some of it is melted down at the Ocean Recovery Project and recycled as sea kayaks to help them find more plastic.\n😍 Wholesomeness  That\u0026rsquo;s a wrap.

Since 2015, the country has cut poaching by 5, thanks to a \u0026ldquo;zero poaching\u0026rdquo; strategy that led to the prosecution of many ringleaders 🐘🎉\n📈 Social Impact Trends  Recent sustainability-aware platforms are moving away from the \u0026ldquo;sustainability\u0026rdquo; label, favouring \u0026ldquo;impact\u0026rdquo; or others, to adopt a more systemic approach and distance themselves from practicing greenwashing. Short Food Supply Chains (SFSC) are gaining traction worldwide amidst global supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 and recent cyberattacks. G7 pledged to scale up technologies and policies that will accelerate the transition away from coal power, including ending new government support for coal power by the end of this year.  🌱 The Underwater Garden While enjoying a vacation by the Italian sea, Sergio Gamberini wondered whether he could combine his passions for scuba diving and gardening to grow basil underwater. Indeed, akin to most herbs, this essential ingredient for pesto prefers protected, sunny locations with well-drained soils and a constant, stable temperature - everything the bottom of the sea can provide!\nFrom this question, Sergio created Nemo\u0026rsquo;s Garden. This project consists of transparent, air-filled biospheres 20 feet below the sea surface to create an alternative agriculture system.\nUnderwater agriculture presents many advantages over standard agriculture. First, the biospheres are self-sustainable in terms of water. Indeed, the seawater at the biospheres' bottom evaporates and condensates on the internal surfaces, creating fresh water for the plants. Also, since the biospheres contain a parasite-free closed ecosystem, no pesticide is necessary. Finally, data have shown Sergio\u0026rsquo;s team that higher pressure conditions positively affect plant growth.\nOtherwise, current experiments demonstrated that the amount of sunlight illuminating the biosphere is sufficient to allow the plants to grow.\nWhy does it matter? Today, 70% of global fresh water is used for agriculture, and the growing population will further increase the pressure on water resources. In this context, agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change.\nFor now, Nemo\u0026rsquo;s Garden is an experiment, and underwater agriculture\u0026rsquo;s limits are yet to be defined. However, this project is extremely interesting for our planet\u0026rsquo;s future as it uses renewable energy from the sun and generates fresh water from sea water desalination.\n🐞 The Team That Wants to Replace Pesticides With Laser Beams A team of researchers in Lyon, France, leveraged their knowledge in artificial intelligence to develop a technology that identifies and removes pests from plants. For their proof of concept, they chose a particularly tough opponent.\nThe pea aphid is a sap-sucking insect that feeds on legumes such as pea, clover, alfalfa, and broad bean. This pest is extremely hard to find since it\u0026rsquo;s only a few millimetres long, enjoys hiding below the leaves and is green!\n​Greenshield Technology\u0026rsquo;s robot can drive through the plants without crushing them and take pictures with its embedded camera. It then uses an innovative algorithm to identify pea aphids in the pictures. Once found, it eliminates them with a patented robotized laser beam.\nThe team managed to calibrate the laser beam to remove the insect without damaging the plant or affect the overall biodiversity in any way.\nWhy does it matter? Usually, farmers get rid of pests such as pea aphids with pesticides. However, only 0.3% of sprayed pesticides come in contact with the target pest. Moreover, they also affect pollinating insects and humans.\nThe Greenshield project could be a major breakthrough for sustainable agriculture and biodiversity protection 🐝\n🎯 The Pick MosquitiaMed is a volunteer-based organization using telemedicine to improve access to health for the Miskitos community in Honduras. This group\u0026rsquo;s first goal is to educate the population about basic healthcare to promote and share community-based solutions to simple health problems. As a result, they solve low-complexity health issues, avoid unnecessary referrals, and reduce complications from lack of treatment.\nFor more serious health issues, the organization provides telemedicine through a mobile application to offer access to specialists in Tegucigalpa, Honduras' capital city. If required, it can also gather resources to move the patient to Tegucigalpa and treat them for free.\nWhy does it matter? Although Gracias a Dios\u0026mdash;the Miskitos community\u0026rsquo;s department\u0026mdash;is the second largest in Honduras, it can only be reached by air or water. Also, this department is one of the poorest and has one of the worst health indicators in the country. Moreover, its largest city, Puerto Lempira, has only one hospital that cannot address complex needs because it lacks supply and specialists.\n🌍 Meanwhile, Worldwide\u0026hellip; 👟 German footwear brand Nat-2 creates shoes from unusual materials (coffee grounds, mushrooms, corn, beans, etc.). Recently, it developed a pair of sneakers from\u0026hellip; bubble wrap. The source material comes from Remeant, a partner company that creates textiles from upcycled plastic taken from landfills and oceans. The only remaining question is, does it pop?\n🤖 When this little girl found out about the ocean crisis, she asked her inventor father to build a robot to save the seas. Alongside his wife, he created Aquaai, a fish-like robot that can immerse within nature to monitor water quality in underwater farms, marine protected areas and ports. Truth comes out from the children\u0026rsquo;s mouth.\n💅 The Kiwi organization Look Good, Feel Better provides free support, guidance and classes to men, women and teens with cancer. The goal is to give some time away from the diagnostic and treatment, and put a smile on their faces when they need it most.\n🐶 The Conservation Dogs Collective trains dogs to detect invasive plants and endangered animals more effectively and efficiently than virtually any human, method or machine. By doing so, these good boys help us preserve wildlife. We don\u0026rsquo;t deserve dogs 😍\n🧭 The Spanish company NaviLens designed a technology similar to QR codes that helps visually-impaired people navigate unfamiliar environments. However, unlike QR codes, which need precise scanning, NaviLens' technology only requires pointing the smartphone vaguely towards the sign to work. These codes are already present in public transport systems throughout Spain and New York. Starting from January, Kellogg\u0026rsquo;s products will also feature them to help visually-impaired people shop.\n📚 In Argentina, the Mempo Giardinelli Foundation created a program called Abuelas Cuentacuentos (\u0026ldquo;Grandmothers Storytelling\u0026rdquo;). The volunteer senior citizens of this program are visiting children in schools or hospitals to read books aloud. The goal is to give them access to books and spark their interest in reading for pleasure ✨\n😍 Wholesomeness  That\u0026rsquo;s a wrap.

She explains that, for most people, \u0026ldquo;it takes 7 to 12 years to start to move forward on helping yourself to hear better.\u0026rdquo; Indeed, transitioning to their new situation takes a process that includes dealing with denial and finding a motivation to move forward.\nHearing Loss Can Affect Us All Hearing loss can affect anyone, even people who haven\u0026rsquo;t gone to a loud concert or experienced a speaker\u0026rsquo;s or an instrument\u0026rsquo;s feedback. Indeed, \u0026ldquo;an extended sound exposure above 80 dB can [also] be harmful to your hearing,\u0026rdquo; she says. Also, Laura warns against prescribed and over-the-counter medication that can be ototoxic as, in some cases, \u0026ldquo;it can damage your hearing permanently.\u0026rdquo;\nFinally, she highlights that people like her, who lose their hearing progressively, \u0026ldquo;might gradually withdraw from situations that put them at a disadvantage\u0026rdquo; without necessarily realizing it. Often, \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rsquo;ll pick up other ways of doing things [and] work around it.\u0026rdquo;\nPOW Hearing\u0026rsquo;s Origin During her post-secondary studies, Laura experienced first-hand the difficulties of interacting with a group of people in real time with impaired hearing. As a result, she had to put several systems in place to capture the ongoing events and conversations.\nAfter graduation, discrimination prevented her from working properly, but her experience made her realize that she could start her own business to better support her community.\nShe has, therefore, built upon the knowledge she acquired during her studies and life experiences to offer multiple fit-for-purpose easy-to-use devices and services related to hearing loss. \u0026ldquo;If a business gets a request by somebody working with them to accommodate that person to hear well at a live event with a large audience, for example, then they will come to [POW Hearing] to set that up for them.\u0026rdquo; As a result, \u0026ldquo;people feel respected and cared for.\u0026rdquo; Laura is currently looking for funds and support with marketing. In the future, she is hoping that existing players in the hearing loss space will join her in her journey to help people in more ways.\nInsights Into Adapting to a New Macro Environment With COVID, Laura had to reinvent herself as she could no longer offer her services during events. The key to adapting to a new macro context is to leverage your strengths vis-a-vis competition and rearrange your capabilities to avoid strategic drift. Usually, this drift occurs over a few years. However, a macro shock accelerates this phenomenon, and companies might have to adapt overnight. Laura probably saved her business by offering \u0026ldquo;clear window lip reader face masks\u0026rdquo; to foster accessible communication and adapt to her new situation.\nInterestingly, these masks also have the side effect of enabling human interactions and facilitating communication, even for people with perfect hearing, which further increases her solution\u0026rsquo;s relevance.\n A lot of people are lowering their masks. This is negating every safety feature put in place! If I am crossing the street, wearing this mask, I have people stop me and say, where did you get that?\n Inspiration to Go! Laura highlights that one size does not fit all for someone who has hearing loss. You can start by asking them what they need. \u0026ldquo;I can give you a list, but it is not going to work,\u0026rdquo; she says.\nOverall, if you look at how people can communicate with you, you should offer a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve them to hear—for instance, an email address instead of a phone number only.\n People who have hearing loss can do everything that people who do not have hearing loss can do, except they cannot hear!\n  Thanks so much for reading this post.\nIf you are a social entrepreneur and would like to share your story, reach out to me via LinkedIn.
